# Zignaly PS2 Backoffice

### How to run

Node version-wise, follow the same instructions as for the PS2 app. Now create an `.env` file with:

```
REACT_APP_BASE_API=/new_api/backoffice
REACT_APP_TESTING_DEFAULT_EMAIL=you-know-what-to-do
REACT_APP_TESTING_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=you-know-what-to-do
```

### Scripts

Unless you want to deal with linking issues and zignaly-ui rebuilds, follow the instructions from the top-level
readme. `yarn run backoffice`. It'll open https://localhost:3001.
