    "7.8. Forks. Digital Assets are based on an open source protocol. Anyone may clone the source code of the Digital Asset and develop a diverging blockchain protocol without prior permission by anyone else, also known as “Forks”. Forks can be made to any Digital Asset that may change the usability, functions, value or even name of a given Digital Asset. Such Forks may result in multiple versions of a Digital Asset Asset and could lead to the dominance of one or more such versions of a Digital Asset Asset (each a “ Dominant Digital Asset ”) and the partial or total abandonment or loss of value of any other versions of such Digital Asset (each a “ Non Dominant Digital Asset ”). Zignaly is under no obligation and may not be able to support a Fork of a Digital Asset that you hold through your Account, whether or not any resulting version of such forked Digital Asset is a Dominant Digital Asset or Non-Dominant Digital Asset or holds value at or following such Fork. Furthermore, as Zignaly does not hold custody of the Digital Assets, we cannot guarantee and assume no responsibility on whether a given Digital Asset Exchange supports a given Fork. If the Digital Asset Exchange does not support the Fork, you may not be able to receive the Digital Assets arising from such Fork. Forks of Digital Assets can be frequent, contentious and unpredictable, and therefore cannot be consistently supported on Zignaly. When trading or holding Digital Assets using your Account, you should operate under the assumption that Zignaly and/or the Digital Asset Exchanges will never support any Fork of such Digital Asset. If Zignaly or the Digital Asset Exchanges elect, in their sole discretion, to support a Fork of a Digital Asset, it may choose to do so by making a public announcement through the Website or the Digital Asset Exchanges respective sites, or otherwise notifying Users, and shall bear no liability for any real or potential losses that may result based on the decision to support such Fork or the timing of implementation of support. If Zignaly and/or the Digital Asset Exchanges, in their sole discretion, do not elect to support a Fork of a given Digital Asset, including the determination to support, continue to support, or cease to support any Dominant Digital Asset or Non Dominant Digital Asset, Zignaly assumes no responsibility or liability whatsoever for any losses or other issues that might arise from an unsupported Fork of a Digital Asset",

The following list of risks associated with Digital Assets, and Digital Asset Derivatives, and the Services is not exhaustive. Please read the Risk Warning for further information.",
    "a) Digital Asset prices are highly volatile and trading in Digital Assets is extremely risky. In addition, several factors may affect market liquidity for a particular Digital Asset, such as regulatory activity, market manipulation, the acts or omissions of the issuer of the Digital Asset, or unexplainable price volatility. By using the Services, you accept the risk of trading Digital Assets, and Digital Asset Derivatives. In entering into any transaction, you represent that you have been, are, and will be solely responsible for making your own independent appraisal of the risks of the transaction and the underlying Digital Asset.",
    "b) We do not advise on the merits of any particular Digital Assets, Digital Asset Derivatives, Copy Traders, PAMM Managers, Signal Providers and/or Digital Asset Exchanges. We do not advise on transactions, or associated risks, or provide any other financial, investment or legal advice in connection with the Services. To the extent that we do provide trading data, post market commentary, articles, or make social media posts, the act of doing so is incidental to your relationship with us and such information may not be considered as investment or financial advice and should not be construed as such. BUYING OR SELLING DIGITAL ASSETS AND/OR DIGITAL ASSET DERIVATIVES IS SOLELY THE USER’S DECISION AND WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENT LOSS.",

Our Relationship does not constitute a Broker-Client Relationship. We do not act as a principal, counterparty, or market-maker in the transactions effected through trading using the Services or in providing financing for financed trading on the Trading Terminal.",
    "e) Users choosing to configure any number or type of trading signals made available by Signal Providers do so with the understanding that Zignaly may not be held responsible for any delayed, failed, or incorrectly transmitted notification. A trading signal may not successfully reach the user for any number of reasons, such as the failure of servers. Even without such failure or delay of an alert, the validity and usefulness of the information represented in a successfully transmitted alert of a trading signal may be diminished due to market volatility, incorrect pricing or other information sourced from a Digital Asset Exchange, or other unforeseen technical issues or market conditions. In particular, a Digital Asset or Digital Asset Derivative may be temporarily or permanently delisted from a Digital Asset Exchange without notice, or support for certain Digital Assets, Digital Asset Derivatives and/or Digital Asset Exchanges may become unavailable, in which case related trading signals may have diminished utility.",
    "f) Zignaly expressly states to the User that it does not guarantee profit or the recurrence of rates of return that have been made by the PAMM Manager, Copy Trader and/or Signal Provider in the past and warns that no positive record of trading strategy implementation ensures the repeat of trading success in the future.",

    "j)We do not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted or secure access to any part of the Services, and operation of our Website or Services may be interfered with by numerous factors outside of our control, including regulatory reasons and issues with various Blockchain networks.",
    "k) Zignaly provides the Trading Terminal, an interface that connects users to Digital Asset Exchanges. However, Zignaly does not operate a Digital Asset Exchange. We do not administer the underlying trading platforms of the Digital Asset Exchanges for the bids or offers and we do not enforce contracts among parties engaged in financing activities available on those Digital Asset Exchanges through the Trading Terminal. The underlying trading platform of the Trading Terminal is administered and operated by the Digital Asset Exchange. We shall in no event be held liable for any loss or other damages, including but not limited to special, incidental, consequential, or other damages arising from the acts of any operator of the Digital Asset Exchange. You are responsible for understanding the Terms and Conditions of the operators of the Digital Asset Exchanges.",

    "m) Although Zignaly uses its best efforts to conduct comprehensive due diligence on the Digital Asset Exchanges available in the Trading Terminal, these Digital Asset Exchanges may be unregulated exchanges and their practices may vary widely, including as to their security, encryption, and liability for losses. Digital Asset Exchanges may not be required to comply with any rules regarding wash trading, insider trading, promoting price discovery, insuring losses, protecting against fraud, ensuring anti-money laundering compliance, and many other salient features. Digital Asset Exchanges may carry on fraudulent operations or fronts for fraudulent schemes and be in a jurisdiction where there is no likelihood of recovery or recompense. Digital Asset Exchanges could provide incorrect, delayed, or otherwise flawed data for a variety of reasons, including as a result of software bugs and the aforementioned limited oversight on markets for cryptocurrencies. Such poor data could misinform the User trading strategies or engender inaccurate price discovery mechanisms. Errors, fraud, and other issues with Digital Asset Exchanges have resulted in extensive, irretrievable losses on multiple occasions in the recent past. The underlying software and mechanisms for the Digital Asset Exchanges could malfunction, executing trades for the Users at faulty prices and adversely affecting the Users’ investments. Digital Asset Exchanges could choose to roll back trades to the benefit of other parties but to the detriment of the Users. In general, errors and unreviewable decisions by the exchanges could adversely impact the value of the investment of the Users.",
