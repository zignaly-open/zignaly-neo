        With the ‘ZigRaffle’ we are changing how the raffles on zignaly.com
        function, adding an array of new features and offerings. Users can now
        directly connect their wallets and place bids on the different auctions
        happening on the “Raffles Marketplace”. Be it the whitelist spots to
        your favorite NFT collection or that basket of tokens going at a deep
        discount, you can put your ZIG to work and place your bids at ZigRaffle.

                Connect your wallet directly to the ZigRaffle site. We will ask
                for your Discord usernames to share instructions with the
                auction winners.

                Since our model allows having more than one winner, we will be
                displaying the names of “current winners” in real time under
                each auction. As a new bid comes up, the “current winners” list
                will be updated until the auction is over.

                Once the auction ends, the winner(s) will pay the “Claim” price
                for the product, directly from the connected wallet.

                Users may opt to buy the product directly from the auction using
                the “Buy now” button.
